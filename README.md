## Responsive Web Design Portfolio Project

This is a fictitious company site to present my skills in web development

### Procedure
The skills being presented here include:
  + Responsive Design
  + Improved Styling with CSS
  + Flex and Grid
  + Documentation 
  + and Debugging
  
### Idea Background
Although the concept of the website should be clear, to clarify, it represents a franchise in which one could walk into a store and walk out with a fully customized Gaming PC.
Much like a certain child's store for stuffed animals, a customer would pick all their parts as they essentially move down an assembly line, getting experince and know-how for future PC building.
The concept is one I have enjoyed for a long time and would help to sell the idea in the future, or make it happen myself.
